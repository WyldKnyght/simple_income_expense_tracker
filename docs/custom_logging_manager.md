**Logging and Error Handling Management System Overview**

The logging and error handling management system is a comprehensive utility designed to provide flexible and detailed logging capabilities across the application. It includes components for logging configuration, error handling, and custom logging handlers.

**Key Components**

1. **Logging Configuration**: The `setup_logging.py` module provides a function to configure the logging system, allowing for custom configuration or using default settings.
2. **Custom Logging Handlers**: The `handlers.py` module defines custom logging handlers, including `DetailedRichHandler` and `ConditionalFileHandler`, which provide rich console output and conditional file logging capabilities.
3. **Error Handling Decorators**: The `decorators.py` module provides a decorator, `error_handler`, which handles exceptions and logs errors.
4. **Logging Constants**: The `constants.py` module defines constants for log record attributes, log formats, and default logging configuration.
5. **File Logging**: The `setup_file_logging.py` module provides a function to set up file logging, creating a new log file with a timestamp.

**Logging and Error Handling Process**

1. **Logging Configuration**: The `setup_logging.py` module is used to configure the logging system, setting the logging level, and configuring handlers.
2. **Error Handling**: The `error_handler` decorator is used to handle exceptions and log errors.
3. **Logging**: The custom logging handlers are used to log messages, providing rich console output and conditional file logging capabilities.
4. **File Logging**: The `setup_file_logging.py` module is used to set up file logging, creating a new log file with a timestamp.

**Custom Logging Handlers**

1. **DetailedRichHandler**: Provides rich console output with customizable formatting.
2. **ConditionalFileHandler**: Allows conditional file logging with buffering capabilities.

**Error Handling Decorator**

1. **error_handler**: Handles exceptions and logs errors, providing a consistent way to handle errors across the application.

**Best Practices**

1. **Consistent Logging**: Use the custom logging handlers and error handling decorator consistently throughout the application to ensure accurate and detailed logging.
2. **Configure Logging**: Configure the logging system using the `setup_logging.py` module to set the logging level and configure handlers.
3. **Use File Logging**: Use the `setup_file_logging.py` module to set up file logging, creating a new log file with a timestamp.

Overall, the logging and error handling management system provides a robust and flexible way to manage logging and error handling across the application, ensuring accurate and detailed logging and consistent error handling.
