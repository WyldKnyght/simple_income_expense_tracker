Here's an overview of the database management system in the Simple Income Expense Tracker:

## Core Components

### 1. DatabaseManager
The central class that orchestrates all database operations through specialized modules:
- Connection management
- Schema validation
- Query execution
- Database initialization
- Default data population

### 2. Schema Management
- Uses `SchemaManager` as the main interface for schema operations
- Maintains a single source of truth through schema files
- Handles table definitions and column specifications
- Provides methods for schema validation and updates

### 3. Key Modules

#### Connection Management
- `DatabaseConnections` class handles SQLite connections
- Implements connection pooling and lifecycle management
- Error handling for connection issues

#### Query Execution
- `QueryExecutor` handles SQL query execution
- Supports parameterized queries
- Transaction management
- Error handling and logging

#### Validation
- `ValidationOperations` ensures database integrity
- Compares current vs expected schema
- Validates database structure
- Schema refresh capabilities

#### Initialization
- `DatabaseInitializer` handles new database creation
- Schema loading and execution
- Default data population through `DefaultDataPopulator`

### 4. Error Handling
- Custom exceptions for different error scenarios
- Comprehensive logging system
- Transaction rollback on failures

This architecture provides a robust and maintainable system for managing the application's data layer, with clear separation of concerns and modular design.
