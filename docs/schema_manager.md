**Schema Management System Overview**

The schema management system is responsible for handling interactions with the database schema. It includes components for loading the schema, retrieving table names, and getting column definitions.

**Key Components**

1. **Schema File**: The schema file (`db_schema.sql`) serves as the single source of truth for the database structure. It contains the definitions for all tables, including their columns and relationships.
2. **SchemaManager**: The `SchemaManager` class (`schema_manager.py`) serves as the main interface for schema-related operations. It provides methods for loading the schema, retrieving table names, and getting table columns.
3. **SchemaOperations**: The `SchemaOperations` class (`schema_operations.py`) performs specific operations related to the database schema, such as reading the schema file, parsing the schema, and extracting table definitions.

**Schema Management Process**

1. **Schema Loading**: The `SchemaManager` loads the schema from the schema file using the `SchemaOperations` class.
2. **Table Name Retrieval**: The `SchemaManager` retrieves the names of tables defined in the loaded schema using the `SchemaOperations` class.
3. **Column Definition Retrieval**: The `SchemaManager` retrieves the column definitions for a specific table using the `SchemaOperations` class.

**Schema Operations**

1. **get_schema()**: Reads and returns the entire database schema from the schema file.
2. **get_table_names()**: Extracts and returns a list of table names from the loaded schema.
3. **get_table_columns()**: Extracts and returns a list of column names for a specified table from the loaded schema.
4. **get_table_definitions()**: Parses the schema and returns a structured format of table definitions.

**Best Practices**

1. **Schema Updates**: When the database structure needs to change, update only the schema file. The `SchemaManager` will then reflect these changes throughout the application.
2. **Consistency**: Always use the `SchemaManager` to retrieve information about the database structure. This ensures that all parts of the application are working with the same, up-to-date structural information.
3. **Version Control**: Keep the schema file under version control to track changes over time.

Overall, the schema management system provides a robust and flexible way to manage the database schema, ensuring consistency and accuracy across the application.
