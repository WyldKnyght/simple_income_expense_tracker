### Key Principles

#### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - Ensure each class and method has one primary responsibility.
   - Refactor any components that are trying to do too much into smaller, focused units.

#### 2. **Separation of Concerns (SoC)**
   - Maintain clear separation between:
     - Data access
     - Business logic
     - User interface components
   - Evaluate and improve the separation of different aspects of the application.

#### 3. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
   - Identify and eliminate any repeated code blocks or logic.
   - Create reusable functions or classes for common operations.

#### 4. **Efficiency Review**
   - Analyze algorithms and data structures used in methods.
   - Identify potential bottlenecks or unnecessarily complex operations.

#### 5. **Configuration Management**
   - Refactor hard-coded settings, constants, and variables into appropriate configuration files.

### Focus Areas
- Clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- Efficient database operations.
- Responsive and user-friendly UI design.
- Potential future scalability in core functionalities.
